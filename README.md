# rachelcliftonyoga

Website created using React for my yoga LLC. 

Right now there are three active pages: home, schedule, and music.


The CSS is currently not all set up, but my focus right now is understanding and using React - will make it all perfect later!

Pages to add: photo gallery, virtual affirmation card deck (see other repository for the command-line version of this app written in Java)
